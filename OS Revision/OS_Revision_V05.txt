File Systems:
    A file is a collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage. 
    Or file is a collection of logically related entities. 
    From userâ€™s perspective a file is the smallest allotment of logical secondary storage.

File Attributes & File Operations:
    Refer Screenshot

Information required for accessing a file:
    1. File Pointer
    2. File open count
    3. Disk location of a file
    4. Access rights

Per Process Table:
    Each process is created with a table called per process table where the filename along the file pointer and access rights are allocated.

Global File Table:
    For entire processes, one common table that has file Attributes for all files like file location and file open count.

Entry in per process table is deleted after completion but not in global file table.
Entry in global file table will be deleted only if the file open count is zero.

Access Methods:
    1. Sequential Access
    2. Direct Access
    3. Indexed Access (Usage of multi level indexing)

We will have more than one file system, when we go for multiple operating system in a computer.

Entire harddisk is divided into various partitions or minidisk or volume.
Each partition will have their own file system.
Each file system will have its own directory structure.

Directories:
    Collection of files is a file directory.
    The directory contains information about the files, including attributes, location and ownership.
    Much of this information, especially that is concerned with storage, is managed by the operating system.
    The directory is itself a file, accessible by various file management routines.
