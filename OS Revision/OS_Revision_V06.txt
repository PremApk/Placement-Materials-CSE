System Calls:
    Whenever we need service or support from the resource/hardware, the user process cannot direclty interact with the resource. Thus, it need to request the OS through system call.
    A system call is a way to interact with the operating system (or) Interface between process and operating system to allow user level processes to request service from the operating system.
    
    A process can call (or) invoke system calls directly or indirectly. 
    indirectly - For example we use library file printf in c program which inturn indirectly calls write system call to display the output in monitor.

    Types of System Calls:
        1.Process Control
        2.File Manipulation
        3.Device Manipulation
        4.Information Maintanence
        5.Communications

    Fork() and exec():
        Process are created using fork system calls.
        Child and Parent will have different Process but has duplication of all data.
        On successful creation, fork() returns PID of the child process.
